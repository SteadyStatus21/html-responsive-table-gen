### Description
Generate a HTML with CSS table from importing the content from an existing Sheet (From Google Sheets or Excel!)
It also has a few nice twists from SteadyStatus21, which has continued this project and corrected some errors.

### Browser compatibility
Almost every device! 

### Development
Requires [node](http://nodejs.org)

- Run `npm install`
- Then run `gulp`

The two key things to edit are `src/responsive-table.js` and `src/table-style.css`.
